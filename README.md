# CSCI-5839-Project

## Project Name
Daily Calories Calculator 

## Project Intention
Diet is a basic component in peopleâ€™s daily life. To have a healthy body, it is not enough to just eat a full meal. People also need to consider the reasonable allocation of diet to ensure the intake of various nutrients satisfies daily calories needs. In addition to that, the composition of a healthy diet varies with personal circumstances (such as age, gender, lifestyle, and physical activity level, etc.). Therefore, the project aims to record users' daily diet and give recommendations based on caloric intake.

## Brief Description of the Project
